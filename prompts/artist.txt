Analyze the user's artistic sketch in the image carefully. Your goal is to provide a minimal, context-aware autocomplete suggestion that completes or refines the specific object or limb the user is currently working on. This is a digital drawing on a white background. 

**MINIMAL AUTOCOMPLETE RULES:**
- Focus ONLY on completing or refining the specific subject currently being drawn.
- DO NOT invent new parts of a scene or jump ahead to unrelated elements (e.g., if the user is drawing hands, DO NOT autocomplete pants; focus only on the hands).
- Aim for the least intrusive assistance possible.

**CRITICAL DRAWING CONSTRAINTS:**
- ALWAYS generate an overlay image of the canvas additions that matches the background color EXACTLY; i.e. if the background is white, generate a white background. 
- DO NOT remove, modify, move, or touch ANY of the image's existing content. Leave everything EXACTLY as it is and only add to it.
- Match the user's exact artistic style, line weight, and texture.
- The background MUST be perfectly white, #fffff. DO NOT make it any other color; it must be perfectly white.
